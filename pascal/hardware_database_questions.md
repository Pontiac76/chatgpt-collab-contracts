Your going to be asked a few common trouble spots you and I have had in the past, and I want to see if the efforts posted in the source codes with the @AI commentary is doing their job.

In this entire thread, do not presume that your answer is satisfactory, and do not ask to "go to the next step".  The user will state what the next step is going to be, or ask what you think the next step should be.

## Question 1:
What is the global database object in use throughout the project?

## Question 2:

## Question 3:
How are we translating SQLite PK fields into a tListbox or tCombobox?
