# OpenAI ChatGPT Collaberation Contracts
This is a list of contracts I use in my ChatGPT sessions when gearing up for long winded, new-chat-because-too-many-tokens-used, coding sessions or projects.

These contracts belong within the ChatGPT instructions for each conversation or project, not within your source code files.

# About me
I've been a "coder" since the 80s as an 8 year old on the Commodore 64, and I know "how to code", but I just have gotten really lazy and I'm really [ab]using OpenAI and Claude to do a lot of heavy code generation instead of my having to write code later, find a bug, and re-evaluate life decisions.

When ChatGPT conversations "get full" I can end up spending 30 seconds to a couple of minutes waiting for the 'first word' to appear, then wait another 5 to get a bunch of stuff I didn't want sent to me.  So this project is an attempt to refine the instructions for ChatGPT (As a start) and other LLMs to deal with my preferred coding style and attempts to cut the fluff.  (I don't need truth tables every single time I ask a question, or have it answer me with my own question, or reword what I just wrote -- Give me what you think I meant, and I'll correct if wrong -- It provides final answers, and we'll always iterate over misunderstandings, like what people should do.)

pfft.. Don't care.  Use 'em and abuse 'em however you see fit.  Got a suggestion though?  Would love to hear it.
